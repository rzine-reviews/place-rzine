	abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

	abstract = {Network analysis is distinguished from traditional social science by the dyadic nature of the standard data set. Whereas in traditional social science we study monadic attributes of individuals, in network analysis we study dyadic attributes of pairs of individuals. These dyadic attributes (e.g. social relations) may be represented in matrix form by a square 1-mode matrix. In contrast, the data in traditional social science are represented as 2-mode matrices. However, network analysis is not completely divorced from traditional social science, and often has occasion to collect and analyze 2-mode matrices. Furthermore, some of the methods developed in network analysis have uses in analysing non-network data. This paper presents and discusses ways of applying and interpreting traditional network analytic techniques to 2-mode data, as well as developing new techniques. Three areas are covered in detail: displaying 2-mode data as networks, detecting clusters and measuring centrality.},

	abstract = {There are two problems in structural sociology that have attracted the attention of researchers: first, the creation of individual identity by means of the social networks in which individuals are embedded; second, that of structural equivalence, i.e. the problem of non-identification of individuals by means of those social networks. The aim of this article is to bring both problems together under a common framework from which both identity and equivalence of individuals in social networks will simultaneously emerge. Or in other words, the study attempts to show that structural determinations of identity and equivalence are just the same. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to go beyond the duality approach insofar as duality represents social structure  either as a network of interconnected social circles or as a network of individuals who are linked by one or some given relations. Accordingly, the concept of place and place analysis is used.},

	abstract = {n social network analysis, 2-mode data refers to data recording ties between two sets of entities. In this context, the term “mode” refers to a class of entities–typically called actors, nodes or vertices–whose members have social ties with other members (in the 1-mode case) or with members of another class (in the 2-mode case). Most social network analysis is concerned with the 1-mode case, as in the analysis of friendship ties among a set of school children or advice-giving relations within an organization. The 2-mode case arises when researchers collect relations between classes of actors, such as persons and organizations, or persons and events. For example, a researcher might collect data on which students in a university belong to which campus organizations, or which employees in an organization participate in which electronic discussion forums. These kinds of data are often referred to as affiliations. Co-memberships in organizations or participation in events are typically thought of as providing opportunities for social relationships among individuals (and also as the consequences of pre-existing relationships). At the same time, ties between organizations through their members are thought to be conduits through which organizations influence each other.},

Since one-mode projection is always less informative than the bipartite representation, a proper weighting method is required to better retain the original information. In this article, inspired by the network-based resource-allocation dynamics, we raise a weighting method which can be directly applied in extracting the hidden information of networks, with remarkably better performance than the widely used global ranking method as well as collaborative filtering. This work not only provides a creditable method for compressing bipartite networks, but also highlights a possible way for the better solution of a long-standing challenge in modern information science: How to do a personal recommendation},

The first approach is to project the data to one-mode and then analyze the projected network using standard single-mode techniques, also called the conversion method. The second approach has been to extend methods and concepts to the two-mode case and analyze the network directly with the two modes considered jointly. The direct approach in recent years has been the preferred method since it is assumed that the conversion method loses important structural information. Here we argue that this is not the case, provided both projections are used together in any analysis. We illustrate how this approach works using core/periphery, structural equivalence and centrality as examples.},

	abstract = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focussed attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},
